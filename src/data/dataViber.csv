So I wrote down in the viber contact page that I was blocked for no reason and to please unblock me because of this. Well what do you know somebody sends back a message by the name of Angelina saying that I would be unblocked after 24 hours and if im not too contact them again. So after 24 hours I was still blocked so I contacted them and asked but guess what somebody named Sofia said that I cannot be unblocked.",1

This is stupid why would someone want his media folder filled with thumbnails from different links. Due to that you cant send a text message with a link bc it will turn into a huge image and the message will be ignored.

bc7b7aa3-e756-4d3e-820f-76e449be56e5,Viber is cool! But i dont like the new simpler smileys. The old cool ones are way better and cooler. It was one of the reasons why viber was better than the others that it had great icons to express emotions... it would be cool if I could choose which one I prefer to use... or just go back to cool ones.,4

638e5d8d-a0e7-4566-85ff-cc9cbbc10acd,I find this apps very convenient to use. I am able to communicate with my family even when I am deployed overseas. Many of my professional contacts are also using Viber which makes communication with them easy even if we are at different continents. Definitely a good apps not only for social interaction but also for my professional work.,4

Many time, when someone is calling you, Viber doesn't ring at all. Instead is staying quiet or in the best case scenario you get message notification about missed call. This is not an issue on my phone, it's an issue which all my friends and family have too. So this is the reason I am giving 3 stars for this app. I hope this bug will be fixed soon.",3

4387846a-975a-4716-bd92-8fab0ef9a7c7,One of the best apps I have used only drawback is if either one or both has put off notification we cannot make or receive call or video call. One more thing noticed there is no lock such as finger print or like that. So one star less for that. Please update the same so can give 5 stars.,4

Instead of automatically removing names, why not ask users if they would like their names to be displayed to those who have yet to save their numbers as contacts?",3

I suggest to make the phone number private or an option to change names on group chats so people can still identify everyone even if contacts are not saved. That way we can still protect our privacy.,5

0d6d875d-17ff-458a-8d78-94c9afda2a4d,Edit: Finally they listened and brought back usernames of non contacts. There is a better way of protecting privacy than what they did in removing user names (that may not be the real name to begin with) but showed the phone numbers (making it easier to get that info to use outside viber platform hence prone to spam or phishing)🤔 Update that removed the usernames of those that are not in contacts lists makes using the platform for group announcements difficult 😑,5

Edit: that's the thing, i dont want to save everybody else's numbers just to know who they are from the group chats. Users have consented on showing the names that's why they assign names or nicknames on the app. We have a viber group consisting of 100+ members, and i dont recognize any of the numbers when they are typing",1

739385ac-78e8-445d-a0e5-2cfd88950869,That security update is sure an inconvenience. They removed the names and you need to save their contact before you can have their names. You should have done it maybe on a different way. We are in a chat group with 70+ members and it is very inconvenient to ask everyone who's who. Imagine those groups with hundreds of members?

6f4e7ad8-aeec-435d-ab30-5bb0d09c8a15,DO NOT USE THIS APP!!! Viber sells your data and lets scammers add you to group chats without YOUR consent. You DO NOT even have a way to report these numvers. They will get hold of your actual phone number and send you scam messages and phone calls through the app and through SMS. Their default settings lets strangers take hold of your number and name. DO NOT USE!!!! This should be illegal.,1

I actually now love this app. Viber freezes 10 times a day on my Galaxy Note. On my Note 2 it hasn't frozen yet but unless I have perfect signal internet calls are horrible.... All together a second rate app.... tango or whatsapp is better....,5

Using the service sharing many things seeing what your sharing and it let's relationships continue to grow.

At the moment (been happening for weeks) I can't easily send any media files. Just gets stuck at 0%, and eventually it remains unsent. Killing the app and restarting it fixes the problem temporarily - ONE file is sent, but the same thing happens for the next one. Same on wifi or cellular. Annoying, but I'm certain it will be fixed eventually.",4

9e8491bb-31e0-4e67-a562-feea438a64bc,"Overall a great messaging app. I've used Viber for years and it has mostly worked very well. One of the things that make Viber so good is how it is encrypted, so only you and your message recipients will be able to see what you send. You can even make messages that dissapear after a certain period of time (and that you can't screenshot whatsoever). Because of that though, the app relies on your own phone to store all photos and chats, so Viber might become heavy on your phone overtime",5
418d99a9-1f54-4d8b-ad6f-d294ab033e0a,Noticed the last few weeks when I send a photo it takes ages to send. It doesn't go through for about 10 minutes. Any idea what's changed recently,3

Either I block *all* notifications, or I keep getting interrupted because Viber ""has something new"" that I don't care about. There is no in-app way to disable this. The only reason I still have it installed is because I have no other way to contact some people. Update post-response: This isn't about ads. There's a chat with ""Viber"" that is unblockable.",1

For who knows which time (probably 10+) in last 3 months or so PC version stops working after update, even if you ignore the update.

The first thing is I can't call others, I can just accept the call from others. The next thing is I can't send messages, Every time I send it didn't send to others so for the both problems, Please fix it as soon as possible. I like the Snapchat stickers the best. Sometime even the connection is good it said it's bad. Please fix that one too. Thank You!",2

I rate this 5/5 hope u learn something from me and found the app interesting and if u did just download it !! It's safe too ( the important part) So ya have a great day !💙,5

da820f04-0a6d-477f-85b7-08884b7ef4af,Viber despite having less clout than other popular messaging apps like Whatsapp and FB (messenger) has earned it's spot here in South East Asia. It is better connected to local telecoms and internet providers and has established relationships that make it the default option at least in my country. Where it loses one star is it's implementation of video conferencing and the actual function of calling.,4

At least the ads have a button that says 'hide' the notification is not always in place and out of the blue recently it made a symbol on my home page so whether I'm in or out of the phone there's a symbol as if I have or missed a call but it always says to return to Viber. I haven't found a way to make that go away either. But it's a great tool friend in Europe,3

7f266194-be47-4332-9018-bc4e895f1999,I think viber needs to rethink about the ban list limit cause after some time we cannot ban scammers who must be banned cause of the limit. Second of all i think its best to give the groups pinning and unpinning power only to the admins cause some of the regular member do unpin the massages that the admins pin. Viber needs to improve these 2 features,3

cb011781-54bd-4076-b407-812b3417f8bb,I was using Viber to call family abroad and right after my latest top-up of the balance my account was automatically blocked. When filling out the support form I get an automated reply saying that my account was blocked and flagged as spam and cannot be unblocked. Feels like Viber took my money and ran with it. This kind of customer support deserves a ban on the app store honestly. Update: It was unblocked. If blocked again it will be unrecoverable. Won't get credits anymore just to be safe.,1

Even when opening the chat for the call there is no sign that the call is ongoing and no options to end it. also the screen doesn't turn off most of the times during a normal voice call. The devs should be ashamed for this grotesquely inefficient app. stay away,1

eaba46a3-fbf8-4a03-8c41-c134c9f4d699,Hi I'm received the email from you. That my viber was reported as a spam. I have not to much contacts in my phone list and I have conversations with really small group of people who are my relatives. So I spent a lot of my time today to speak with all of them about that. NO ONE of them reported SPAM. To be honest they don't know how to do it. So here's something wrong. Please investigate my case again! P. P. Already shared but not ansver and no any changes. I am still can't use Viber.,1

Can't understand why you changed something that worked perfectly. Thanks very much.,3

When i try to call someone it displays ""call failed"" message on my screen and then, few messages from a particular contact delivered. I have done virtually everything from my own end. I'm certain it's not my network connection, because every other app on my phone is working at a good netwrk speed. Please i need urgent response to this before i go ahead in rating the app five star!!",3

That's who you'll talk to here if you're under 35 years old. Also, there's an option to turn off the outgoing message sound, but guess what - there's no option to turn off the message reaction (like, laught etc) sound. So there's time to develop a sticker market but there isn't to implement a basic setting. Nice job.",1

Support service is completely unhelpful sending automaticaly generated emails: 'Your account has been blocked and cannot be unblocked'. Noone else can be contacted. Many years of conversation with my family has been lost for me now. It is very disappointing. I am not surprised that most people use whatsapp or messenger rather than Viber.,1

So when I installed the GMS on my phone the app found the existence of GMS and tries to use them over HMS, but it fails, because Huawei Phones are no longer certified to use GMS. HMS should have the priority over GMS as no user with fully functional GMS will need to install the HMS on his phone.",1

d3a16f10-6390-46ce-b60a-1bc3b38728f0,Wouldn't give any stars at all. Had Viber for years but used it very little. Today tried to call my friend and wasn't able to. Couldn't reactivate the account after the reinstallation. Message popped to look for Viber hepl. That's the team support reply came my number was blocked because it was reported as a source of spam or as a result of unusual activity. The account has been automatically added to a block list and can not be unblocked. Seriously?!!,1
eb9fb20c-e74c-441b-b536-c4abf322efd5,I have been blocked on viber they say for spam or suspicious activity I only have one person I chat to on viber no one else so I can't understand why they have blocked me it's my only means of chatting to my friend abroad I can't afford to make direct calls this has made me very sad I don't do spam and I don't do suspicious activity at all my viber was working early yesterday then for no reason they blocked me and won't unblock how can I possibly be spam or suspicious activity with one contact,1

24d7c09c-f78a-4c01-b810-727bf8ca158d,Very convenient messaging app and also for file sharing . My only issue with the app ( and I'm not really sure if this is a problem with Viber ) is that my phone ( and my mom's ) doesn't make any sound alerts whenever a message comes in . There will be a notification on the phone status bar but no alerts or chimes and this made me late to read my messages . I already tried to fix both app and phone settings to no avail . I hope you can help me on this issue . ( Note : My phone is a Samsung A71 4,5

No other way of log in or account recovery yet they still ask for your email address. Very hassle. People in my country would have a change of number if they come from prepaid simcards to postpaid. Atleast allow number change on desktop application or have a qr code log in. You privacy policy does not make sense if you'll ask for our email upon log in/account creation if we cant use it for account recovery,1

I know your answer is security but shouldn't you leave that to the end user? this app is a waste of space unless you find someone that's willing to change their texting app and that is just stupid thinking on the developers part. force someone to convince their friends. ridiculous.,1

There will be a notification on the phone status bar but no alerts or chimes and this made me late to read my messages. I already tried to fix both app and phone settings to no avail.

0fb44b49-d2ed-43cf-bcc5-32e6a674e249,Last few months keeps cutting out after 30 secs or a few minutes. This started when you introduced the adverts. I have used this app for years to talk to my daughter overseas. Now we can hardly chat as it disconnects so quickly or you ring and they can't pick up or you ring and it cuts out before the number can ring. I wish you could fix this. It was a life line for many years. Now just so frustrating and disappointing.,2

2de043c8-7cab-4fe8-a186-aa9b500f6f01,"There are two major problems. First being the AD experience and AD-s constantly showing within chats. The second problem is a bit specific but could be annyoing to litterly anyone. When sending pictures you select them in order how you want, but when you send them they litterly mix the order which can be really annyoing. Best app to use without this problems and with simmilar experience is whatsapp. Whatsapp also has end-to-end encryption which is basicly standard for today's chat aplications.",3

I didn't want to give a bad review, but a month has passed, and still no fix, which is very irresponsible. If the issue is with ads turn them off until you resolve this. When you turn off mobile data and. the wifi app will not load ads and it will work, of course offline, but it will not crash. Not sure why is so difficult to fix this. Guys, the app is not running, I believe this should have the highest priority.",4

I specifically denied permissions to access my contacts during the installation, and yet the Viber spammed all my contacts that I've installed Viber. 1. I didn't allow it to access my contacts. 2. Why would a software send anything to my contacts without even notifying me about it? I'm not even talking about asking for my consent. Sure thing I'm uninstalling it. Hope Viber will send notification about that as well. It's not normal for software to do such things.",1

When I contacted the customer service they told me they cannot refund or compensate for poor call quality because I've use the calling credit. How do I know about the problem if I don't place a call? There are so many less than 30 sec calls in my Viber out call history which doesn't seems to be a proof of poor call quality for the customer service agents!,1

a0399964-e074-49fe-8579-90a7c9155be9,It works but Uber has a tendency to change rates and get a ride to one place or x number dollars and when you come home they can be charging you up to double maybe even more depending on the circumstances has nothing to do with mileage or anything except how greedy they are and how hard up you would be for a ride. Example we just have to be several times is he $8 ride to a location after 2 hours trying to go home $49 as long as this as there are no laws against this so beware.,4

979fb538-ae84-474a-a710-71f496e873e8,When I was in grade 5 I used this app to contact with my friends. This app brings back a lot memories not only this app looks and works great it is actually really simple to use too. I recommend anyone I know to use Viber and the best part is it has an end to end encryption and doesn't record any personal data how WhatsApp do so this is the best app I deleted WhatsApp and moved on to this wonderful heavenly place soo good and beautiful I love it. I've been using this app for 7 years now.,5

After troubleshooting and reinstalling the app it wouldn't let me register. Got notified that my number was blocked for some reason but should be good to try again after 24hrs. Still no luck and unable to register. Pretty disappointed,2

And one more simple thing is missing. It's custom notification sounds for specific contacts. Many worthless apps have this option, it is strange that serious app like Viber does not support this. Hope it will be added with future updates. Best regards.",4

a220eaf9-aee0-4422-af6c-0942b20a2f58,Viber is one of the favourite app. But i gave you 4 Stars. Reson : We cant send private messages in the app. I mean we cant send messages without show number. If we send message they are always chat with us. And if we block them after they use another number to chat me. This is the probleam im Faced. Other wise is good. I Love The app. ❤️💙🧡💚🤎💛.,1

Viber doesn't keep chat history in the cloud. I had to uninstall at one point, then installed back and lost years of messages. To keep history, it demands access to read and write into Google Drive. I won't give it access to my files, because it is a Chinese app with Russian investors, so I don't trust them to follow privacy laws.",1

3dadb620-ba6f-4609-934e-d31e741a4278,"Generally Viber is an ok app. However it has been going from bad to worse.  More particularly the main issue is that it shows it is disconnected due to internet, although the internet works fine. It takes several attempts to call but most of the time I end up restarting the phone. Messages are also delayed. There 're also frequent occasions where some will call and it will cut off before you even able to look on the screen and no missed call is left.  There is no issue with my S7.  There are better messaging and video calling alternatives that Viber becomes a time waster app from the past.",4

They cowardly set up a 90 days term, after which they think its fair not to give people their money back, or simply steal them. They have burried the information into common ""terms and conditions"", instead of clearly informing people how to do that at the moment of money transfer. This is disgusting and dishonest, done on purpose of stealing your hard- earned money!",1

This happens because app and its call do not have highest priority as it shoul be. Call must have highest priority and thats why the cell phones are created in the first place.,4

f2e60af3-d7e4-4edf-bab2-f35d4429d88f,Can't use it anymore as either I can't hear my fiance or he can't hear me. It's like it gets muted as we're on calls. We've used this app for 5 yrs to talk to each other and now we have to use snapchat. My fiance already got in contact with viber support team they were useless and said we need good internet for it to work. Funny thing is we've both had great internet for the 5 yrs we used it why now.,1
