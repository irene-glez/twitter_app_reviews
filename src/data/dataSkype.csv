a30b903f-d84e-4427-94ba-e4f2b05f1eb8,"Loved this app. Skype was so great. Since Skype was acquired by Microsoft, it is so much heavier. It takes longer to move around the app because it's so heavy. You should have a high-end phone in order to use it.",1
aff2ed88-90da-4307-818b-b4b6e8256a0f,The picture profile setup page seems to be stuck in an infinite loop of maximising and minimising. Could not finish setting up and therefore couldn't use.,1

86fbc198-550c-4e95-a99d-4da0eaa7cfd9,My contact list shows people from 5 years ago. I've turned on sync in the settings but the contacts don't sync. There is no way to reach customer service. This app really sucks. I don't understand why this should be so difficult.,1
8a770605-c4c0-4c31-9be1-d14f0807850e,I don't know why developers aren't paying attention to Skype's serious problems. I wasnt able to send one single message through the app using mobile data. I kept changing between 3G and 4G networks and I keep updating the app and searching for solutions here and there yet nothing changes. Why can't you build it in a different better way? Why can't you make it like the so many properly working chatting apps? I hope a solution can be found in the next update where skype works fine on mobile data,1
9adbb06f-e466-41d2-ac48-4389edde2277,I have tap up my account more than 30 days ago they didn't charge my account they said I should have purchased directly from skype or Microsoft. So I requested my refund from Google play they refused to refund it. Now I don't have the money in skype and they don't refund my question is where is my money then!,1

We have to disconnect the call and dial them back which is the only option. This is lingering and apps getting hanged sometimes though the network is good. Not sure what could be the reason.

I could not manage subscriptions and even cancel it so I could reinstall it and still use it. The entire Auto charge seems to exist only to take your money then never be able to cancel. Beware. None of the instructions to manage the subscriptions lead anywhere but in a circle.,1

They removed that ability and now my camera covers up people I'm trying to video call with. The overlay feature for Android breaks often so you can't see the other person's camera while outside the app. Also they need to add audio controls for when your not using a Bluetooth headset. Sometimes the audio routes to the headset instead of speaker while in video calls and you can't switch unless you reconnect them.,2

67a69fa0-1889-4502-9bf8-fbe77a30ef85,Skype has gone way down hill. The makers of this app do not care if it even works or runs properly. I would use Skype for a regular messaging app because I did not want to use other messaging app providers but Skype has become so poor in quality and unreliable I don't think I can even use it anymore. I am extremely disappointed with their service and would never recommend it to anyone. Do not waste your time with Skype you will not receive notifications consistently and messages do not send.,1

99d60f22-93d6-4a1f-b98e-96e071eb4b43,Skype for Android doesn't have an option to switch your camera direction. This means that you cannot switch from selfie mode to the opposite camera mode like say if you wanted to show somebody something you were looking at. This is so basic and every other video chatting app has it. It's a huge disappointment that Skype does not offer this very standard feature..,1

With other apps on the rise like ZOOM I think Microsoft drastically needs to shift gears and focus on salvaging there 8 billion dollar investment before its to late... ZOOM whent from 1k downloads a day to over 3 million when the global pandemic hit. I'm no rocket scientist but the way I see it Skype has got real competition for the first time and is swiftly loosing popularity to said competition.,1

2abe5e06-0e4b-4dba-ba7d-7f5985d9251a,Skype has become almost impossible to download much harder to use ever since Microsoft bought it. Microsoft needs to make Skype independent completely the way it was when it was a really great app. I can't even download it to my brand new Samsung Galaxy s1 Plus that never used to be a problem. Leave it to Microsoft to complicate everything and take a good thing and make it bad.,1

In stock Android 11 permission settings, I denied it the ability to read and write contacts, and denied the ability to modify system settings. After opening it, I found my contacts modified and the settings changed to allow read and write to contacts. I then tested it on a rooted phone which monitors this kind of behavior and confirmed that it is indeed ignoring the user's settings and force-enabling settings it wants to use. That's explicitly circumventing permissions controls which is the behavior of malware. This application is a virus as far as I'm concerned.",1

Sometimes it refuses to connect to the Bluetooth (even if the device is connected and it works fine with a regular phone call). After a Skype call (video in my case, if it makes a difference to the devs), media audio won't come out of the Bluetooth device until one force-stops Skype. So while the app works pretty well overall, there are a few annoying kinks that need to be worked out when you use a Bluetooth headset.",3

Skype has absolutely no technical support, it is long served by bots and abandoned. Yesterday I got a message in my mailbox telling that there was supposedly something wrong with my Microsoft account tied to Skype and they suggested that I should restore it. When I went there and started to restore - they asked the last 4 digits of my phone number. I entered those 4 digits correctly for every hour in 6 hours - I still hadn't received the SMS. Without this SMS I wasn¬¥t able to access Skype. All my efforts to contact customer service ended up with a range of weird questions on the front page of Microsoft leading absolutely nowhere. None of them were instrumental in solving my problem. In the end, I gave up and went on to restore the entire Microsoft Skype account. The account holds important contacts and business correspondence with colleagues. Now they are asking me to fill in the form with the data like ""the content of your last 3 messages in Skype"", so the chances of restoring account are close to zero. Absolutely ridiculous.",1

7a2c4e64-f7ac-43bc-be73-d986e82917f4,"Skype has been around since 2003, but still needs refining in both video calls and messaging. Usually video is good but sometimes freezes or becomes choppy. The audio is usually very clear but sometimes choppy, or one side cannot hear while the other can. On messaging, sometimes the messages take 30 seconds or much longer to send. If you leave the Skype window, the sending will stop until you return to Skype. I don't know the technical nature of these flaws, but wish for improvement.",4

But overall I can send messages without any problems. But it could be just an issue with my phone, because on my laptop it hasn't been a problem. But I haven't been able to use my laptop in a while because I need to have someone replace the battery on it so hopefully it still works once I do get the battery replaced.",3

Second you guys should really remove the function of being able to screenshots cause of a friend had a terrible experience because of that function.Third if you are going to keep that function don't let the screenshots be saved like let it be a 48 hour type thing and then it gone. Fourth Skype let use delete our Skype accounts without having to delete our Microsoft accounts cause honestly it's dumb that we can't do that.,1

For instance when a call is picked up,a notification blocks the speaker-phone button so you have to start the call on the earpiece and ten seconds later change to hands-free. The app is not intuitive and in fact difficult to use and it is no surprise Skype has fallen out of favour. The only reason to use Skype is the great audio and video quality.",4

Can't even see my teacher's screen sharing from desktop to android!!and whenever I join any call they let me enter without turning off mic! And when I try to turn off mic then it took too much time ! Literally 5-10 second just to mute mic? While google meet is doing same in just one click under! Why don't you fix it skype? other option isn't working perfectly same as mic!,1

No doubt this app is having a large or huge no of customers which is also increasing day by day but it doesn't mean that quality is going down and you are not able to do anything about it. In the past this aap works fine on old devices too. But now it needs higher speed devices only and still creates issue on that. Do something about it please..........,1

I instead use Skype to do all my calls and it saves so much money! I have the subscription with 100min for land-line and mobile which it perfect. If I need a land-line number I can set one up for only a few quid a month. So long as my signal is good it is a perfect call. Still using it years later and very happy.",5

And, there aren't any irritating, loud ads that pop up whenever I use it. The one thing that does bug me is the fact that if I'm trying to text a number that isn't a phone number it doesn't send because the country code gets applied automatically and I don't know how to temporarily remove it. Otherwise, it's a great app.",4

At that time internet connections were very poor and the sound quality inconsistent. My advice is to get a good internet connection or Skype won't work well. Also there can be problems if your devices with platforms aren't compatible with each other such as Android, Chrome, Windows 10, Apple iOS. Once you get it set up it works brilliantly, especially with Skype's latest updates. Enjoy.",5

This is not the Skype you may be used to in the past. Today's Skype is a good app. Update 11.9.20: Still very good and very reliable. Use it without fear. Update 2.26.21: Remains outstanding.

It has simply gone downhill since then with basically every update. The main reason im writing this review is because of status-issues though. It simply cant seem to keep the status i set on my desktop or phone, it changes to online after some time (its random sometimes) The really weird thing is that a few days ago, i chabged to ""away"" on my desktop, opened it on the phone and it should keep the same status, but it changed to online automatically. So, i change to away on the phone as well but in the morning when i get up its online on my desktop even if still away on the phone. So, i change to away on the desktop again, goes back into phone (still away) goes back to my homescreen and booom it goes online on my desktop! I mean seriously? this status-issue has been going on for years now and it cant be that freaking hard to fix it. If i want to have my status as away i should be able to until i manually change it and not become online at random. Not so fun to randomly become online at say 4 in the morning and people think that you are online and sends messages/calls. I have had lots of patience through the years but ill be switching to Telegram unless this thing is fixed. Its a bit sad since for me the call and audio/videoquality in skype is great.",3

Finally, I decided to use Skype but was surprised by the different charges required to do so. After making the call and reflecting on the bill, I was confused and spoke to customer service. The rep I spoke to was incredibly kind and professional. He took a great deal of time to explain the different charges. He was also very kind and helpful overall,. I don't necessarily agree with all the different fees required to make a call to a phone number through skype, but their customer service was absolutely great. tl;dr - Good app overall. Charges made to call numbers outside of the skype system can be pricey. Best customer service I've ever received.",5

Chat media store is among the worst, not loading all pictures and videos from a conversation and taking a long time when it does. You also cannot send voice recordings on the PC version. Audio/video quality is OK, but it does not take advantage of fast networks although HD calls have been promoted for a decade. Skype does not allow you to use it in split-screen mode with another app which is a big drawback for me.",3

I'm not sure where the problem is...I uninstalled the app and pre-installed it but no use ... is it a bug from the new update? please fix this issue. kindly note that I asked my friends and they also face same issue ... but on pc we are not facing this problem .",1

I hope that this app would be better if, Skype adds the feature of showing the name of the person who is ending the call when the call ends for everyone. So, the teachers would be able to recognize that person and take necessary actions. Other than this, Skype has fantastic features and can be used smoothly. Hope you will look into this.",3
