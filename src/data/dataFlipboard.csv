Confirmation bias is the goal here, for monetary gain through advertising. IT IS UP TO YOU to tell Flipboard you want apposing views so that you can apply critical thinking. Facts w/out opinion are hard to come by here. Update: To be fair, facts w/out opinion are hard to come by anywhere in mainstream media. USERS must CHOOSE sources carefully & THINK critically!",3

04b4674e-a4eb-482b-9ef2-405eac4dab0e,I'm back to Flipboard after dumping Twitter as a news feed. Android app improvement requests 1) Add a 'View on Web' general setting so that all articles open in my browser of choice instead of having to manually select 'View on Web' 2) A better widget. You're a news aggregator. Why do I only have access to SEVEN stories and have to tap a button to scroll? Very bare-bones solution 3) 'Briefing' used to be what I want but apparently that is now morphed into this 'Samsung Free' abomination.,3

Haven't had any problems with advertising, vacuous fundraising or such issues so far. So why not? Five stars (so far!)",5

c5e0f360-802e-40f7-b684-7674e235006d,Flipboard is a 'permissions farming app'. You'll be signing away your online permissions to literally thousands of dodgy companies as you flip and click on stories. It sends you a vast amount of highly suspect sources which often cannot be described as news. Also features highly repetetive scam ads where you'll be presented with exactly the same ad every 6 or 7 'flips' for example an ad that says you can remove ads on your phone by sticking a paperclip into it. Downright irresponsible.,1

There are still quite a few adds but Flipboard has added an easy to use button at the top of the page that removes the adds and subscription notice on most articles. There are still a few news outlets that block their articles if you don't subscribe to their news outlet. I avoid those outlets and refuse to subscribe to their publications when I can find the same news elsewhere. I like to read through my Flipboard daily on my before I start my day.,4

Every single person closed the conversation and sometimes without even writing back. Ery surprising they treat users this way. Will be searching for a better news aggregator if they ignore me a 6th time. Can't believe I've even given them this many chances.,2

4391398a-c87c-4398-a26d-96fe31756187,I've had to change my review from 5 stars to 3 stars. When Flipboard works as it should its great. But when it doesn't its bad-really bad. I like opening it up normally to a newspaper like reader. There are usually 1 or 2 stories and then I flip through my interests to the end. But sometimes it randomly switches to a 'forced flipping' format that is horrible. The content is old-sometimes weeks out of date. I just have to close it and wait a few hours for it to revert to its original form.,3

The in-app browser however feels outdated in terms of how it displays content. Texts are too small. You can't zoom in to enlarge the text. Videos take forever to load. Chrome and Samsung Internet optimize their visuals for mobile-viewing. Maybe borrow a leaf or two from them? Jus saying,3

Suggestion: Add a folders feature to the 'Following' page so magazines can be grouped by topic. Sometimes i hesitate to follow more stuff because the Following page becomes too congested and too annoying to organize. If i could create separate folders for topics that interest me that world be great. I think others would love this feature as well.,5

Finally, this last notification of an unapologetic left leaning media source was the last straw. I prefer the transparency of Ground News, tending to promote balanced views.",1

There is only one point of view represented 99% of the time. Shameful for an app claiming to be news. Should be classified as propaganda. They post a couple dozen articles a day about anecdotal situations involving black and white people in confrontation. Stories that get easily led people riled up against conservatives. They are hurting race relations in U.S. so much. Horrible.,1

895434ee-1e31-41fa-ad69-e8e7e3ddfa36,I've used Flipboard for many years. Up until now it has been my main news app. Unfortunately I stopped using it and deleted the app after the slow decline over the past few years. It all started when they decided to include blogs and opinion editorials. There's just so much junk to weed through. Blogs and such are usually tied to a major news organization.... and Flipboard won't allow you to block individual bloggers... it makes you block everything that comes from that news outlet.,3

At least give the option to view the full headline somehow without clicking (thus triggering an article view on limited sites) 2) several major collections are being forced to scroll even when flip is set in settings. This is likely to enable their annoying new ad that pins itself to the top when scrolling past. (update: it's apparently a known bug that's being worked on. Refunded a star),3

a1df3971-8731-464d-90c2-0c79e4c857e3,A good app for news and information. The difference between other news app and Flipboard: 1. Flipboard curates and caters to the type of news based on your personal settings. 2. Other news app tends to dump the articles to the user based on assumptions. 3. Other news app will inadvertently try to influence the user. 4. Flipboard is just trying to inform the user.,5

There must have been a recent update that has created a miserable user experience. Some of the ads click through when you are flipping. You're not double clicking the ad... Just flipping through the articles. It's a really evil way to get click-throughs in my opinion. I'm hoping you will get rid of this change soon!,2

20060e3c-0a8e-49c4-848a-cfa01c001c4c,While Flipboard is good at aggregating news and is easily customizable the biggest drawback is the HUGE amount of data it sucks up. This app is a DATA HOG! Even with minimal usage while roaming it consistently consumes an average of 70%-80% of my monthly data plan. IMO it's because of the amount of ads it lets through and lack of control to block them. Altho does have a very crude control to stop videos\images from loading it renders the app useless since it's too difficult to know the content.,3

Only thing I seem to recall from memory that in the past many things were converted into flippable articles. Now the scroll articles are a pain as they sometimes grow and shrink as different ads load. Some put a 'read more' and the click box is offset from the button so it clicks an ad just below.,5

126fdc5e-5ba6-4101-a821-6af97f93544a,Been using flipboard for quite some time since you can customize what news you see or just flip through all news. Biggest down side is tbe comment section is really subpar and broken up into different sections. Dont even bother commenting if you see 100 plus comments because your comment is lost at the bottom. Other than that is a nice app to see any news you want.,4

I don't mind updates or changes, but now it's difficult to figure things out. What's more, some things don't seem to work. For example, I told it a few times to put a custom magazine on the home page, and it never did. For another, you can't easily import Twitter lists like you used to. I had made Twitter lists for various news agencies, organized by subject or region, and used that to customize my Flipboard design. That was the best! But now? Even when I try to connect it to my Twitter account, I can't seem to access my lists. To top it off, when I try to delete my account, it tells me, both for my Google and Twitter account, something like, ""You've already logged in with this. Please log in and try again."" Huh? So the app is literally telling me, ""You can check out any time you like, but you can't never leave."" Great.

Flipboard is neat and the ads are not annoying. I'm only giving 4 stars because: 1- adding an rss feed isn't easy with flipboard and I only learned that it's possible from an article. 2- It doesn't always add the RSS feed even if I add the link correctly. It just sometimes gets no results. 3. it's no clear what layout density is or what its options do,4

Often I can't share, like, favorite or comment on an article until I've refreshed - then sometimes I lose the article. Dev feedback to restart/clear data helps once - then same bugs with new articles. The wordt part is very limited controls on what articles I see. I cant say ""less from this news outlet"".

The ""home"" view is essentially an ad. Pages only show 3 articles at a time, too.

55ffbffe-1ddc-4724-ad5c-377d2f2c6757,It is full of unwanted advertisements. However what concerned me the most and it should CONCERN you TOO is the fact that Flipboard aggressively started to suggests ads of products or services that I didn't search for anywhere in the web but instead I had ONLY spoke about them. One example was when I briefly spoke about the water pressure in my shower and wished it was stronger. All of the sudden a DAY LATER I was targeted with ads about showers to increase the water pressure.,1

Full page ads and ad videos popping up when not even using the app. Pop up ads while I'm on the phone or texting or whatever! and they are tricky ads that make you accidentally click on them by putting their accept button right where you would normally hang up your call..etc. This invasion is the ultimate in app evil!

afb6f674-2577-4ca0-8b3c-a51ac5cb7255,Phone app makes commenting horrible. Posting multiple comments on an article requires leaving the comments and reopening them. Accidentally switching your phone from vertical to horizontal will cause any comments you've been writing to disappear forcing you to rewrite them. Briefing isn't available or working on my device so there's just an ugly box with the article on my screen instead of like briefing. The comment section itself is mostly political with some really toxic commenters.,2

207f87b6-fb2e-4dc9-9cdc-fbbaa2f7e72c,I enjoy a hit of the news. there are too many news articles from media companies that I have to subsribe to. previously for example autosport used to allow 15 free articles per month. now Its 3! I would rather block autosport from my list and read the same articles free from other reporters. I accept that advertising is embedded in articles to pay for the article but I might have to shop around for an alternative if every article I might want to read needs a subscription.,1

77793f2c-21e0-4db6-9ded-fdb7f5f33f58,"Hi, great app. Really love it and use it on a daily basis. The only criticism (and hence reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is when browsing articles that have horizontal scroll i.e. showing example code, it takes the scroll left gesture as meaning I wish to go back to the articles category (to find another article). This is an annoying control and causes no end of frustration for me. Let me know if this gets fixed and I can adjust my rating accordingly :).",4

I just didn't want my profile picture there, and it kept popping back up after I used the ""Remove Photo"" option.

And if there's a popover ad on the site, it's usually game over, and I have to reload the app entirely.

Kudos for that (can't get away with ads like that, but the number of sources not allowing or botching the ""fetch just text+images"" thing got just huge by the end there). Alas, no dark theme nor actual usable, scrollable widget in sight. The funny thing, I remember using Flipboard Briefing with my Samsung phone, and in fact it was the ONLY thing I loved about the default Samsung Launcher. Sadly, if you run pure Android/ or are using Microsoft laucher, there's no alternative to it =( I wish you guys would just copied and pasted Briefing's look and functions into a widget, that would have been so wonderful. Old review: OK, my previous review got unnecessarily angry (sorry). Still, an actual scrollable/flippy home screen widget seems to be long overdue. Dark/night theme would be nice; as would be a ""view on web by default"" setting for sources that have for some reason scrambled their ""as article"" view.

Today I'll be uninstalling this app from my phone after being one of it's first users for many years, but being complete unable to filter out certain sources (mostly and particularly Washington Post and NY Times). I could still live with skipping those sources untill lately, a couple of months or so, they created a new, completely biased and brainwashed propaganda topic sent to the users every day called ""What you need to know"" or ""What mattered today"". Don't they have to bring out news to you and let you decide what's important and mattered? I came to US at the age of 27 from one of the former soviet republics and know from the first hand what propaganda is and what does it look like and have very low tolerance level of anything that is biases itself as ""news"" but being rather propaganda in reality. I'm really sorry for all those young minds being firstly brainwashed by professors in their colleges and their inability to recognize the real ""news"" and distinguish it from something that will ruin this great country and, probably, the entire civilized world which will be taken over by those who search for our weaknesses to bring their own way into our society. What a sad times we're leaving at and Flipboard, among others, will have to take full responsibility if (G...d forbid) it really is going to happen. Bye-bye Flipboard, I will not miss you",1

You'd think that debacle would be an all hands on deck bug, but it persists. Flipboard does have it on their known issues list, so that's a positive at least. They only give a work around though, and no indication that they are working on a fix. I still greatly miss Zite and only went to Flipboard as a fall back. If Flipboard won't even flip, why should we even bother with it. Also as others have noted, fix it fast or I'll move on. 11/1/18 UPDATE: the issue with flipping has finally been fixed starting with v4.2.4. Thank you. Moved from 2 to 4 stars.

f8ea4f8f-a9ad-4ad6-a86c-5cfc88e51104,It's ok. I've a few peeves about the app that are becoming more and more annoying. If you happen to swipe right (even subtly) in an article (sliding images or adjusting the page) you flip out and you lose your position in the article. Highly annoying. Even so often (seemingly randomly) you're suddenly thrust back to the top of your feed and you have to wade through dozens of articles to get back to where you were. It seems to be a well curated set of articles and relevant but these annoyances are rather off-putting. Best of luck not getting irate.,2

Playing off that, some stories don't have enough tags. Under the Men's Fasion catagory I get articles talking about the top 10 yoga pants for women, and when I go to say that its off topic the article is only tagged with fasion which makes it so I can't even attempt to correct my feed.

To actual reply: Yes it prevents push notifications for Scam sites, but Android itself has a better settingof disabling apps notifications. The issue isn't that I get notifications, but that the links behind that notifications navigate to scam websites. Since this link is from the actual 'news' article, opening that article from the in app browser yields the same result. I am not willing to browse news, when I have to fear that this app opens malicious websites in the app itself instead of first showing the link and the asking for the browser to use.

Whatever algorithms are finding the articles are only ok, and considerably worse for certain categories. Some of the categories are also very poorly named/defined... ""Computers"" for example, surfaces pretty much any political article involving any piece of technology. The feedback system seems lacking. While it has some of the common causes I'd want to report an article, about a third of the time I can't communicate accurately with the limited options. Lastly, there is one hyper annoying interaction. Swiping right on an article takes you back to the article feed. A huge number of articles have graphics features which require you to swipe right on them... Slideshows for example... These aromatically exit the article.",4

18b7043a-1d6f-4e22-82d9-75fcfa3cacea,*update* September 2018 - despite the boilerplate response my previous review generated from flipboard you should be aware that their staff is 100% liberal and they do NOT punish abusive liberal commenters. You can report them as much as you like but nothing will be done. However if you're at all conservative you'd better walk on eggshells because the flipboard TOS is extremely broad and even if you go to great lengths not to use foul language and to not fight fire with fire all it takes is for one bleeding heart to report you for stating a conservative belief which they find objectionable and it's over for you. It won't matter that they called you an effing piece of s*** all the flipboard staff cares about is that a lefty got their feelings hurt. This could be a great app if the staff were even remotely fair. Caveat emptor.,1

I've been attempting to login to my old account for the past 5 days with no success. I have hundreds of articles saved and want them back. I wasted hours attempting to change passwords and emails, only to continue getting the same ""unable to login"" and ""retry later"" messages as before. At this point, I attempted to login on the website and had NO issues, so I know my information is correct. I noticed that the website has you login with your USERNAME and password, whereas the app asks for your email and password. So, I think to myself, ""what if I just type in my username instead?"" Sure enough, it works without any problem. No thanks to the developers. You need to FIX THIS IN YOUR APP. If you fix it, I will change this to a 5-star rating.",3

7d59a053-1aeb-4169-9f7e-eef30bd9a000,"Flipboard users be aware!—Be careful when using it to get your news. This app started out great, but over the years it has not changed as news media culture as become more sensationalized, underfunded and prone to measure success by number of clicks. As a result, the app tends to return a lot of click-bait, from only a select group of articles that doesn't represent well a spread of source, tone, bias and content. This is especially true in more specific magazines such as ""Politics"" and ""Science"", (a LOT of click-bait in Science. So much that has become almost meaningless to use Flipboard for science news. A straight up web source of collected articles, such as Science Daily does a much better job). In Politics, for example, notice the prevalence of articles from far-left news source, Salon, compared to the number of articles of conservative news source, Fox News. Notice how there's even less from the much more centered news source, ""PBS News Hour."" Not saying they're politically bias. Only using this as an example where the return is very lop-sided where you wouldn't necessarily want it to be. In general, you will see some news sources more than others, but I cannot think of a good reason why when there is so much out there to go to. It would help me use the app better if I knew how, exactly Fboard's algorithms return data. But Fboard has never been very open about this.",2

In fact, at one point I contacted customer support to try and report the problem and I was told that my account had been chosen to take part in a trial program where I would be shown articles at random to see whether or not I would find those articles interesting. This was done without my consent or knowledge. Since then I've contacted customer support several times to report similar issues yet I still have to flip through a bunch of unwanted content such as irrelevant celebrity gossip, cooking advice, or my personal favorite, ""7 Tips for Making Anal Sex as Pleasurable as Possible"" and ""The Most Important Thing to Stay Safe During Anal Sex."" Keep in mind that I have no interest in these topics and that I've used the features for refining the results of my feed accordingly. Customer support suggested I either block/mute these sources or report sources that violate Flipboard's community guidelines.

Some news are interesting because you don't have the time to search. Nevertheless I prefer Google to redirect my curiosity on news. I prefer flipboard information on exercise and other special requests. Plain news or critical news just leave it to Google.,3

bccfb341-e2d5-46f9-9994-83f0cb1b0977,"Since I discovered Flipboard it has been a reliable source of most of my favourite subjects and news. Agreggating so many different sources, Flipboard gets to be relevant in a day to day basis, at the point that I'm simply ignoring most of my previous news sources, even when it relates to very specific subjects like ""Hard Science Fiction"" or the discussion about the ""Fermi Paradox"" to me one of the most interesting and intriguing issues of modern science (you can't really box the Fermi Paradox discussion in only one field of Science. It adds Biology to Chemistry, to Evolution and Astro Physics, going through cosmology, Religion, Technology and the difficult task of interstellar travel, which humanity must face in the next 100 to 300 years or face being stuck here until the Great Filter comes for us. Ok,input of topic but this is just an example of how deep you can go inside Flipboard. Kudos for the Editorial team who mix actual news with topic news, editorials, opeds, academic articles and all ou day of amazing subjects. The capacity to create your own ""magazines"" ,to easily share them and any news, and the nice layout, functional navigation (usability + user experience) is a plus. The only cons on my opinion are some publications that don't make the effort to port their content articles to the Flipboard format. Its not coming but u always see pages with bleeding text, very tiny fonts and a dated design and internal navigation that make me think it they have a quality control check in place. Flipboard would be doing a great service simply asking those pyblishings to adapt or leave. I don't think I could have the sane level of clarifying and diverse news with any other single publication Marco Mattano",5

Completely different from phone layout, and incredibly unintuitive. No categories available (cover stories, news, diy, gaming, etc) the density choices do nothing. Swiping on tablet is all left/right while the phone is up/down. Pointless bar across bottom of entire app. The me u opens up a profile page that has the same exact info as the main page. Pointless and redundant. On the phone, it's incredibly elegant and a joy to use. The tablet is an unusable mess of conflicting UI/UX. How do you screw this up? You don't need a completely different UI because of 2"" more screen space. It's not like resolutions are vastly different across these devices. Honestly, the number of times this app has completely redesigned is disconcerting, and makes me feel the devs have no idea what they are doing. This may be the straw that broke the camel's back. Feedly has been a pretty good experience lately. Bonus: every page flip glitches and produces artifacts on tablet. UPDATE: 8/21/18 updated the app and it's even worse. Now it will only show me the ""for you"" section and complains that my home is full. This app was much more useful in like, 2013. Gonna find an old apk to get back a useful version again.",1

improvements are: 1. Add reading lists and a ""Save for later"" option so 
when I don't have time to read an article I can revisit it later. 2. 
Improve the ""Less like this"" option. The problem is it can only filter 
suggestions by tag or source. When I find an article that's too partisan or 
is click bait, it's often the case that I like the topic and appreciate 
some articles from the news outlet, so I can't filter out suggestions I

Topics/stories show up on the app that can'tt be edited/removed. The same topics don't show up on the web but the stories still display. For example, Apple shows up as a topic on the app but not the web. And no way to edit them on either platform. How does something go from a 10 to a 0 in such a short period of time? How does something become so unusable? How does the data become so irrelevant? Sadly, Google Newsstand is probably the only alternative until Flipboard fixes this mess but I'm not hopeful.",1

I end up on articles where I dont want to be and or cant open article I want to see.  That said Fliboard briefing developed for Samsung works better for me than standalone Flipboard on Samsung tab 3.  It is more intuitive.  I also do not like the fact that articles you read are full of commercials.  With Pocket that gets stripped down and you read text only with images.  Do not think such an option exists on Flipbard.,1

you would get rid of all the required subscription sites, then it would be 
useful. Ex, The Washington Post comes immediately to mind. UPDATE : In 
response to your reply, why put that burden on the user. Why not properly 
vett your sources? I would rather do without the irritation and 
inconvenience. But you cannot permanently remove this app. It will 
automatically reinstall. I feel that is also wrong.",1

bf3f16f2-c650-4793-a348-c91527f1013e,"april 2018 update: they seemed to have flattened the interface base on my 
chromebook experience somehow. no longer flips, but scrolls. aggh. leave it 
alone! it looks nice and behaves very well now. it also seems to be better 
at aggregating a main page from all of your selected sources than before, 
when zite was aquired and shut off before zites adaptive AI aggregator was 
incorporated into the remaining product. whatever is in there now is 
approximately functionally equivalent, but still does not offer you new 
content from different sources bases on a pattern match. perhaps it does 
not matter. it nicely manages to aggregate content you have subscribed to 
as well. it has always had a better interface than zite, and these days, 
does the best job of managing page orientation swaps of any android app on 
a chromebook tablet out there. I basically have stopped lookkng at the 
times, the economist, pc magazine, etc, in separats apps any more. I still 
hate the way zite was done, but time heals all wounds I guess.",5

pay gaps, and countless other articles spouting typical nutjob liberal 
nonsense. Today, I got another article making claims about ""the majority of 
Americans"" with no source to support that claim (because it's B.S.). If 
it's not that, it's an article using anonymous sources saying things like, 
""according to 3 sources close to the investigation"". How stupid do people 
have to be to not recognize the fact that any article using these tactics 
and methods are most asuredly outright lies and blatantly false news 
reporting. Flipboard should raise it's editorial standards and not allow 
this unintellectual propaganda on it's app. Journalistic integrity sure has 
taken a complete nosedive and platforms like flipboard that do not hold the 
writers to high expectations are complicit in it's decline.",1

articles (no videos) blew through my whole month's data allowance in a

is 3 weeks until the end of my billable month. Thankfully Android 
identified it was Flipboard and told me it was using 100s of MB. 2. 
Spoilers. Flipboard has noticed I like motorsports and it's really hard to 
turn off *all* the related feeds it thinks I will be interested in. This 
means I see the results of races I haven't yet watched. So I must simply 
not open Flipboard some days in case it shows me spoilers.",1

I quite often don't know where I am in the maze of magazines, or once I'm out of one place, how to get back to it. It can be a bit frustrating. Also, sometimes the notifications for new stories don't always go to the articles they're linked to... although this problem seems to have been fixed now.",4

I like that you can save articles cause they're not easy to find again if you don't.   The one big downside to this app is that it'll send you a notification about an article, but when you tap it, it rarely goes to that article or a page where you can access the article. You're better off Googling the title or subject matter than trying to find in the app.",3

I love the board spectrum of information I easily have access to..its IA is pretty strong and often provides new and insightful choices. However, if they would just stop using stories with either paywalls or sites that don't allow ad blockers it would be 5, not 4 stars. Because of everything that happened with Equifax recent breeches, I will not operate my phone without a blocker and other high security measures. If that's too big an issue for Forbes then I won't read Forbes. I prefer Flipboard give me the option to Omit any of their information",4

The headline items on the opening page cannot ever be found.  And lately it has become ridiculously slow to load, to the point of being useless.  Update: Flipboard have replied asking me to contact them through the feedback in the app.  That looks very responsive, but it won't wash.  As an early adopter I spent several years sending them screengrabs to illustrate that the ""uk technology"" section had no UK stories at all ( why did they ask for screengrabs? Surely they can open their own curated streams???)   recorded the updating sluggishness and sent them video files,  sent them loads of other feedback over several years.  It just got worse and worse.  It's very clever to respond to google store feedback, it undermines my comments.  But it doesn't wash with me.",1

I've waited for a long time for this feature and even continue to add articles to my magazines, but because I do most my reading offline, I find I just don't get to read them.

You have removed all feedback while saving an article to a magazine. There is no confirmation button, no multiple posting option and no visual cues before/during/after. This makes Flipboard just an ordinary RSS reader.",2

ab123ae2-fb0b-42e1-835b-53a4b34647f8,Used to like this app for alot of different information but in the past while I see it promotes left wing agendas and news sites. Too bad we live in a world of biased reporting. Dropping to 2 stars and not 1 because the science is still somewhat interesting.

You get to choose topics, but not all the specific sore you may want. It's ideological more than a news service.",1

Furthermore, the page flipping feature is ridiculously unstable and articles are too easily lost in the sea of meaningless articles and gossip stories. Uninstalling.",1
1aaa6752-7b9c-438e-b790-561f04a3f6b7,"I am uninstalling this app. I have had it for about a 1 and half years and it just doesn't work well. I am surprised by all the positive reviews. Whenever the app puts up a notification about an article and I tap it, it doesn't take me to the article. It brings me to a list of other articles. The same thing happens when I use the screensaver feature. I will see an article displayed on my screen while my phone is plugged in. I tap on the screen for the article displayed and it brings me to the lock screen, and after unlocking the phone I see a list of unrelated stories. If I scroll down the list, I might find the article I tapped on originally, but not always.   Add on to all of this, they display articles from extreme-left political websites like Vox, Jezebel and Buzzfeed. I want news, not unbridled political opinions.  The best way to use this app is to see notifications for news stories, then go look them up on Google. But why would you want to have to take that additional step. Just get a news app that actually works in a way that makes sense.",1
